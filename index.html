  <h5>skux things to do</h5>
<p>You can be skux, but also be bored. this page is the solution to that problem. When you are skux, and feeling bored it is best to go to some mean assssss skids, have a feed at kfc, colour in a colouring book, or do some silent reading. MOst people who have embraced their skuxness
will know that if they follow their hearts, anything can be skux. Things that most skux people enjoy for activitys, are usually daily life things that have been made skux because it is a skux person doing it, like snorkling in the ocean, rock climbing, getting haircuts in north korea, hunting, bouncing on a trampoline, and running away from the police ricky baker style.
the key to skux activities is that you can really do whatever you want, and it will be skux if you are skux also.</p>
